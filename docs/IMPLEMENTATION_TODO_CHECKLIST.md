# Implementation Progress Board

Last updated: 2026-03-06

## 1) Program Overview

This board is the single source of truth for delivery progress.
Detailed task tables are maintained only for modules currently in active implementation.

## 3) Active Section Task Board

## Meta Info Retrieval (Deterministic) - Stabilized (Collapsed)

Scope (frozen for next-stage handoff):
- Stable deterministic resolution for DOI/arXiv/title.
- Canonical paper/author metadata persistence in DB.
- Predictable cache semantics with inspectable artifacts.

Decision:
- Collapse detailed task tables for deterministic paper+author metadata retrieval and DB hardening.
- Keep only deferred non-critical backlog and wish-list items.
- Move active implementation focus to next-stage modules.

### 3.1 Stabilization Summary

| Area | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Paper metadata determinism + guardrails | Done | `tests/test_retrieval_deterministic.py`, `tests/test_retrieval_rc1_matrix.py`, `tests/fixtures/deterministic_benchmark_cases.json` |
| Author metadata persistence + cache-hit fidelity | Done | `tests/test_retrieval_index.py` (`author_reconcile`, `cache_first` author-fidelity tests) |
| DB hardening + cache/index behavior | Done | `tests/test_retrieval_index.py` (`cache_first` full-path, index uniqueness, legacy compat, artifact size-bounds) |
| Observability + fresh-session smoke | Done | `tests/test_retrieval_rc1_matrix.py::test_cold_start_matrix_and_cache_replay` |

### 3.2 Deferred Backlog (Post-RC1, Non-Blocking)

| Item | Status | Priority | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cross-source author canonicalization | Todo | P1 | Duplicate people may still occur with partial/weak IDs; acceptable for most current flows. |
| Metadata backfill for legacy sparse index/DB rows | Todo | P1 | Existing rows are compatible but not auto-enriched retroactively. |
| Deterministic fixture pack CI rollout/expansion | In progress | P1 | Fixture pack exists and is tested locally; CI wiring + larger corpus pending. |

### 3.3 Wish List (Non-Blocking)

- Add fallback to web-search-based paper/author retrieval using existing OSS integration points.
- Add `homepage_url` (or equivalent) to author schema and retrieval pipeline.
- Add optional richer author profile enrichment fields after next-stage stabilization.

## 4) Non-Active Modules (Summary Only)

| Module | Next Gate To Open Detailed Board |
|---|---|
| Agentic Meta Info Retrieval | Open now: deterministic metadata layer is stabilized and handoff-ready. |
| Data Backend and RAG | Open now: deterministic metadata schema and cache policy are stable enough for integration. |
| Paper Context Retrieval | Metadata layer can reliably resolve and cache canonical papers. |
| Paper Context Formatted Extraction | Context retrieval contract is stable. |
| Analysis Skill | Extraction artifacts have stable schema + quality controls. |
| Output Skills | Analysis outputs are stable and versioned. |
| Overall UI Design | Core retrieval/extraction APIs reach stable semantics. |

## 5) Milestone Status

Achieved:

`M-Deterministic-RC1` (2026-03-06): deterministic retrieval stabilized for handoff.

Evidence snapshot:
- DOI/arXiv/title deterministic behavior is benchmark-fixture covered across policies.
- arXiv queries hit DB cache correctly regardless of canonical paper ID prefix.
- Author and author-org links remain consistent after metadata updates.
- Cache-hit paper/author metadata fidelity is preserved.
- Deterministic artifacts remain compact/readable with provenance in TSV.
- Fresh-session deterministic regression coverage is stable.

Active next milestone:

`M-Next-Stage-Launch`: begin Agentic Meta Info Retrieval + Data Backend/RAG with deterministic layer frozen except bugfixes.

Done when:
- Detailed active task board is opened for Agentic Meta Info Retrieval with first sprint acceptance criteria.
- Detailed active task board is opened for Data Backend/RAG with deterministic artifact integration contracts.
- Deferred deterministic backlog and wishlist remain explicitly non-blocking unless they become concrete blockers.

## 6) Next Fresh Session Task Queue

Use this queue at the start of the next session:

1. Open the Agentic Meta Info Retrieval detailed board and define first implementation slice + acceptance tests.
2. Open the Data Backend/RAG detailed board and lock contracts for `deterministic_result.yaml`, `deterministic_request.yaml`, and sources TSV usage.
3. Add CI wiring task for deterministic fixture pack as a scoped support task (not a launch blocker unless integration fails).
4. Keep deterministic P1 backlog and wishlist parked; only pull them in if they materially unblock next-stage delivery.
